# Scrambled Eggs

Let's unscramble this folder.

The end folder structure should looks like this:

```
src
  index.html
  images
    icons
  content
  fonts
  styles
  scripts
```

Create a `README.md` file in the same folder and list every step you take, and which command you use. Also, track every step you make with `git`.

- all svg images should be placed in the `images` folder inside the `icons` folder
- all images that are not svg should be placed directly in the `images` folder
- all markdown files should be placed in the `content` folder
- all markdown file names should be lowerase (use `rename` package)
- all the font files should be in the `fonts` folder - no html files, no txt files, no specimen files, no css files should be left
- all JavaScript files (ending with `.js`) should be in the `scripts` folder
- all CSS files (ending with `.css`) should be in the `styles` folder
- files in styles should be all lowercase
- files in scripts should be all lowercase
- once the folder is unscrabled use the `tree` package to print the folder structure and add it to the `README.md` file
